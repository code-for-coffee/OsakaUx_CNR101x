# 1. Higher Cognitive Function and Language

## What are higher Cognitive functions?
* *cognitive function* is an intellectual process by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas. It involves all aspects of perception, thinking, reasoning, and remembering.
* *higher cognitive function* is an individual mental function involved in the frontal lobe. Examples: categorization, decision making, abstraction, insight, problem solving, planning, and execution.

* The frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for a lot of cognitive functionality in the brain.

## What is language?
* *Language* is a cognitive function. It is a skill that allows us to translate input and generate output.
* Natural language, computer languages, etc.
* In this course we are focusing on computation modeling.

#### Language is Symbolic

Two fold - signal vs symbol:
- Signal is a low data; continuous flow/stream.
- Symbol is a very discreet data.
- These two types of data contrast one another.

#### Reconsider...

- Reconsider "language" itself.
- Think about "language" and the brain.
- *The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of language and the brain* by Terrance W. Deacon, 1998.

#### How to design robots that speak language?

- How do we have robots that evolve to understand language?
- How do they form cognitive functions?
